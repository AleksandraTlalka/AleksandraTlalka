### Hi there 👋
Welcome to my Github page! Let me introduce myself - I’m Ola, Aleksandra to be more formal. Right now I'm studying computer science at the Silesian University of Technology (Poland) so my page is composed mostly of student projects. 

### Programming languages 🖥️
My main programming languages are Java and C++, but I also know C# quite well.
I have also some experience with C and ASM but I can't say I enjoy working with them.
I’m currently learning how to create Unity games and web pages with HTML, Bootsrap, React and CSS.

### My interests 💬
My favorite activity is solving logic puzzles and problems.

### Joke of the day 😄
What are computers' favorite snacks?
Microchips, phish sticks, and cookies. But just a few bytes of each.
